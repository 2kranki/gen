* Clean up when done:
    * unneeded files
    * write any extra needed documentation

* GenSqlApp:
    * Clean up that all accesses to the generated struct must be with TitledName()
    * Setup a Dockerfile and associated bash shells to run it so that we can
        containerize the generated application.
    * Main Menu Generation
        * Allow file path to be selected for Load and Save CSV
        * make it prettier lol
        * possibly convert to form ???
    * Form Generation:
        * Field order and display grouping (JSON indicated)
        * Field Length in Form
        * All HTML forms need to be converted to using html/template and they should
            only have data added no html codes ???
    * table handler
        * Do optional csv transaction update processing
        * form.html per table
            * Try to do all the single record stuff in one form
            * Add ability to switch back to list form or main menu from this record
        * tablelist.html per table
            * Allow some selection criteria
            * generate switch to single record mode and back
            * when switching to list start at the record that you were at in Maintenance
    * table I/O
        * tableio.go - change to <database_name>DB so that we can have
            several db's per JSON definition
    * dbData
        * Add Foreign Key support into the JSON (needs table name and key name)
    * If we included the field/table tables in doPkg in the io package, we might be
        able to generate a more table-driven application that required less code generation.
* possibly json to struct converter and vice versa
* Add optional monitoring/statistics in the handler and io packages,
    need data extraction as well.
    * number of times handler is initiated
    * number of various errors per handler
    * length of time in various handler functions
    * ability to send stats to slack
* Add optional python interpreter and connect the handler and io packages to it. ????
* Set up dockerfile or docker compose for generated app and build in start up for sql docker containers
