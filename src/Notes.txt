# My objective with this program is to be able to generate applications and objects
# in several languages.

# In developing this program, I have accidentally over-written the base files of
# the program several times and had to reconstruct the over-written files.  Since
# I wasn't doing commits very often, the reconstruction was sometimes a little
# painful.  Now, I am doing lots of commits. So, that any reconstruction is rather
# painless. lol  Live and learn!

# When I first started coding this, I moved a lot of code out of the templates and
# into the generation functions.  As time went by, I learned that this was a mistake
# especially when you are generating fmt.Sprintf code.  It is much harder to wrap
# head around generating code that will generate code than just put it in the
# template file and supplement it with small functions.  At a later date, I will
# rewrite some of the code and templates to reflect this.
