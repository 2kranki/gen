My objective with this program is to be able to generate applications and objects
in several programming languages. I found the templating system in Go to have
every feature that I needed for this project.

In developing this program, I have accidentally overwritten the base files of
the program several times and had to reconstruct the overwritten files.  Since
I wasn't doing commits very often, the reconstruction was sometimes a little
painful.  Now, I am doing lots of commits. So, that any reconstruction is rather
painless. lol  Live and learn!
