                            MariaDB Docker Container

You can find the documentation on the MariaDB Docker container here:
    https://hub.docker.com/_/mariadb

MariaDB is a fork of the MySQL project. So, we handle them both the same for now.

There are several commands that you will want to learn to use the container. First
is:
    docker image pull mariadb:latest

This adds the MariaDB container image to your local Docker images. Once, you have it
added to the images, you will want to run it. The following will do that with the
defaults that the generated application will automatically use:
    docker run --name mariadb1 -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD="Passw0rd" -d mariadb:latest
                            or
    ./run.sh
You may get a "missing mariadb1" message and that is ok. Ignore it.  You can issue
one run.sh after another, because it kills the one running and gives you a clean system
to start over with.


After you have it running, you can stop it with:
    docker container stop mariadb1

And restart the stopped container with:
    docker container start mariadb1

To delete the container that you created with the "run" command, you do
    docker container rm -f mariadb1
                or
    ./kill.sh

This delete does get rid of the Docker container image. So, you will have to
run.sh to create a fresh container.

So, for testing, you issue the "run", then do your testing. If the database is
no longer useable or you want to start from scratch, you simply do another "run".
If you want to quit and get rid of the container, just do a "kill.sh"
This is why testing using Docker is so great!
