The objective with this program is to be able to generate applications and objects
in several programming languages. I found the templating system in Go to have
every feature that I needed for this project.

There are port conflicts if we did not change some of the defaults.  For instance,
MariaDB and MySQL use the same port for communication. So, I changed the default
port for MariaDB when not being accessed in a docker-compose. Also, each application
needs a unique port number. We handle that in the test generation. Look in "/misc".
