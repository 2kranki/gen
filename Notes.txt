I have started changing genapp to conform to golangci-lint and pylint. Maybe I
should have started out that way, but we did not have these tools when I first
started programming and I never really used them until now.  I recommend that 
you install them and get used to using them. In today's environment, CI is the
rule not the exception and rightfully so. My bad! I will correct all the code
over time.

The objective with this program is to be able to generate applications and objects
in several programming languages. I found the templating system in Go to have
every feature that I needed for this project.

There are port conflicts if we did not change some of the defaults.  For instance,
MariaDB and MySQL use the same port for communication. So, I changed the default
port for MariaDB when not being accessed in a docker-compose. Also, each application
needs a unique port number. We handle that in the test generation. Look in "/misc".

Over a period of time, I am going to move the components around to better match the
"https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout" standards.
