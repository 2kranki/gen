This directory contains the scripts that I use to run PostgreSQL.

To implement PostgreSQL, I used PostgreSQL native on MacOS since I had it installed
from before.  Also, I used pgAdmin to add the "Finances" database under "postgres"
which is the default user. From there, I was able to get the connection string
done and running.

Now that I had it running native, I turned to running it through docker. To set up
a Docker image of PostgreSQL, I did the following:

    * I changed the port from 5432 to 5430 since it seemed to conflict with the
        installed PostgreSQL.
    * "./run.sh" loads postgres1 from the Docker Postgres Image with everything
        established properly except for the database being defined.
    * I had to use pgAdmin to create the "Finances" database under 'postgres' user.
        It needed to be predefined before we could use and the generated program
        did not seem like the right place for that. You select the "Databases" in
        the right hand column and then "Create Database".
    * Now you can run the app with "/tmp/bin/app -dbPort=5430" from the command
        line.
    * The shell scripts in this section should work:
        ./run.sh        <- Create and Run the postgres1 container
        ./exec.sh       <- Allows you to peer inside the container and make adjustments
                            if needed.
        ./kill.sh       <- Kills and deletes the postgres1 container
