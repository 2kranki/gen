This directory contains the scripts that I use to run the various databases using
Dockker.  If you are not familiar with Docker, I highly recommend that you learn
how to use it.  It basically is the way to build a self-contained system for a
single purpose that is easy to manage and use.  Most cloud computing sites now
support Docker images. So, I will probably set up the generated output so that it
can run in a Docker image as well.  Anyway, there are several books and websites
that offer Docker training.  I used udemy.com and took the "Docker Mastery"
course by Bret Fischer. I supplemented it with the book, "Docker Deep Dive", by
Nigel Poulton.  Between the two, I felt that I go a decent education on how to 
use Docker.

If you want to know about Docker internals and do things inside Docker containers,
you should get a fundamental education on Linux and Bash that is what they are
based on.  I run MacOS which is a Linux like operating system under the hood. So,
I already understood Bash and the fundamentals.  I like MacOS a lot. I don't al-
ways like Apple. lol  However, if you have an iphone, running an Apple computer
works well.

My experience so far is that Apple computers are more expensive, but they come
with a lot of the software that you would have to buy for a Windows machine. So,
it seems to be a wash.  Anyway, I have had good experiences with Apple so far.

Back to Docker...

Please look in the individual subdirectories to learn how I run the Docker
containers for the various databases.
