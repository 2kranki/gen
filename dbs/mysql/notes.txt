                            MySQL Docker Container

You can find the documentation on the MySQL Docker container here:
    https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql

There are several commands that you will want to learn to use the container. First
is:
    docker container pull mysql:latest

This adds the MySQL container image to your local Docker images. Once, you have it
added to the images, you will want to run it. The following will do that with the 
defaults that the generated application will automatically use:
    docker run --name mysql1 -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=Passw0rd -d mysql:latest

After you have it running, you can stop it with:
    docker container stop mysql1

And restart the stopped container with:
    docker container start mysql1

To delete the container that you created with the "run" command, you do
    docker container rm mysql1

This delete does not get rid of the Docker container image. So, you can create
a fresh container by simply running the "run" command as above.

So, for testing, you issue the "run", then do your testing. If the database is
no longer useable or you want to start from scratch, you simply do a "stop"
followed by a "rm".  The next time that you need an image, you just issue the
"run" command again and you start over from scratch.  This is why testing using
Docker is so great!
