                            MySQL Docker Container

You can find the documentation on the MySQL Docker container here:
    https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql

There are several commands that you will want to learn to use the container. First
is:
    docker container pull mysql:latest

This adds the MySQL container image to your local Docker images. Once, you have it
added to the images, you will want to run it. The following will do that with the
defaults that the generated application will automatically use:
    docker run --name mysql1 -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD="Passw0rd!" -d mysql:latest
                            or
    ./run.sh
You may get a "missing mysql11" message and that is ok. Ignore it.  You can issue
one run.sh after another, because it kills the one running and gives you a clean system
to start over with.


After you have it running, you can stop it with:
    docker container stop mysql1

And restart the stopped container with:
    docker container start mysql1

To delete the container that you created with the "run" command, you do
    docker container rm -f mysql1
                or
    ./kill.sh

This delete does get rid of the Docker container image. So, you will have to
run.sh to create a fresh container.

So, for testing, you issue the "run", then do your testing. If the database is
no longer useable or you want to start from scratch, you simply do another "run".
If you want to quit and get rid of the container, just do a "kill.sh"
This is why testing using Docker is so great!
